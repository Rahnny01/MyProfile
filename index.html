  <h3>My Introduction</h3>
  <p>Hey guys! My name is Rahnny. My student number is S3818720 and my email is Rahnnytajaran01@gmail.com
    I am currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology and Working full time in the Hospitality industry.
    I was born in the Philippines and migrated here when I was 17.
    I speak Filipino and English.
    My favourite sport is basketball.
    I have a daughter, her name is Zoe and she means the world to me :).
  </p>

  <h3>My Interest in I.T</h3>
  <p>My interest in IT is programming and cybersecurity. It started when I was in high school. I was always good with computers and when my family have troubles with them, I was the one they always go to. My interest sparked in cybersecurity
    sparked when I first watched Mr. Robot. I liked the idea of defending cyberattacks and strategizing against hackers.</p>

  <p>I chose RMIT because of its reputation and reviews by other students who have also attended the same course. RMIT ranks high in University rankings in Australia and graduates have great job employability.</p>

  <p>I expect to learn about mainly programming, algorithms and data analysis. I also expect to learn about I.T in general. What makes a good I.T person and what path to take in the industry. I really would love to learn more of the technical side
    of I.T because it interest me the most.</p>

  <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
  <h4><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39833565?searchrequesttoken=8034d630-e503-4fe2-aa4e-b03f8391f33b&type=standout">Cyber Security, Technology risk and Compliance manager</a></h4>
  <p>This job will be mainly creating strategies and solutions to prevent clients from cyber-attacks and security threats. This position is appealing to me because of how much problem solving there is and being responsible for overall system
    security.</p>

  <p>One of the skills required for this job is deep understanding I.T. understanding of cyber security planning, system control and risks. High knowledge of computer networks, software, hardware and various security technologies. Years of experience
    in the industry is required mainly in the field of Cyber security. A tertiary education in I.T/Computer Science/Cybersecurity.</p>

  <p>Skills that I currently have are knowledge of basic computer hardware and software, PC building, basic HTML, routing and switches and Microsoft office suites. I am currently studying Bachelor of Information technology.</p>

  <p>My plan is to finish my degree in I.T. While studying I will start to look for jobs in the I.T industry which is most likely I.T support at this stage. I plan is to obtain experience whilst studying which will increase my chance of getting
    employed after graduating. I am choosing to go this path because I think that most employers these days value experience more rather than qualifications. I am also planning on doing Master's degree in Cyber Security part time while working as a
    developer.</p>

  <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>MBTI result = The Advocate (INTJ-T)</li>
    <li>Learning style result = Auditory Learner </li>
    <li>Big Five assessment = O/60% C/46% E/25% A/79% N/62.5%</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These results mean that I am always looking for improvement and open for ideas. It also means I am in the introverted side. I learn by hearing and listening. I often will follow instruction better if it was spoken than written. I often help
    others when they are having trouble with something or needing help in general.</p>

  <p>When forming a team, I should consider what personalities my team members have. This is to avoid conflicts and work out a system which will benefit the team as a whole. As for myself, I should not be shy and keep myself away which will affect
    the team negatively. I should learn how to mesh with the team and involve myself in team ideas.</p>

  <h3>My Project Idea</h3>
  <h4>SOLUTIONS TO PLASTIC POLLUTION (STOP)</h4>
  <p>A smartphone app that helps spread the word about the dangers of plastic pollution and the negative effects of it. This app will help you find a place to recycle plastic waste near you. It will also alert you if there's any local organisational
    clean-up happening near you that you can join. This project will be created by 5 people. Each has objectives of their own; 1 will be in charge of research which includes plastic pollution effects, recycling centre locations, what types of plastic
    they accept, organisations that address plastic pollution, which shops has bans on single use of plastic bags, takeaway containers and plastic bottles. 2 people will be in charge of coding using JAVA, 1 will be in charge of design and the last
    person to be in charge of professional writing and QA.</p>

  <p>What inspired me to have this as my project idea was how big of a threat this is to our planet and the massive affects to the health of our ocean but still not a lot of people are doing anything about it. People still use plastic negligently and
    are not aware of its dangers. I have been wanting help spread the word internationally in some way and help remind that we can change the world to be a better place for the future generation. My wife and daughter love going to the beach and it
    saddens me that a simple walk to the beach, there are plastic present. A little amount of plastic on the beach seems safe to us humans but it actually affects our marine ecosystem negatively. <a
      href="http://www.nationalgeographic.org/news/ocean-trash-525-trillion-pieces-and-counting-big-questions-remain/3rd-grade/">There is an estimated five trillion pieces of plastic
      floating on and in the ocean<a />. There are numerous projects, policies and organisations that hope to prevent plastic pollution, but I don’t think this will be enough considering how much plastic there are in the ocean. At this rate we will
      need
      everyone's effort to battle this problem. </p>


  <p>This app will be called Solution to Plastic Pollution short for STOP. This ap has 4 important features. When you first open the app, the app will show a quick tutorial on how to navigate this app. First feature is that when you first open the
    app, it will educate you on plastic waste and its effects on our ocean. It will show information regarding the decline of our ocean health. It will show slides of photos which show the oceans around the world full of plastic. It will also show
    facts, figures and statistics of plastic waste. This app will be very simple as we are aiming to have this app very user-friendly. I think that if everyone can use this app no matter what smartphone or platform they have, it will be to easier to
    get everyone to download this app. I also think that having an incentive system in place will get more attraction for users to download this app. Second feature of this app is that it will find the nearest recycling centre at your location. It
    will show information about the recycling centre like how to contact them, business hours, and what type of plastic they recycle. Third feature is that it will alert you when there is a local organisational clean-up happening near you or an
    international event that are is currently happening or you want to participate in the future. This app will also social media integration so that you can share photos or videos on any social media platform. The fourth feature of this app is that
    it will have a side game. The objective is to collect and recycle as much plastic waste as you can. This app will track how much you recycle by gathering data from recycling centres. It will calculate how much plastic waste you have recycled and
    will convert these to points. This side game will have a levelling system where win rewards. Rewards consists of money, clothing, food etc. To be able to get these rewards, you will need to reach certain levels. For example, by reaching level 10
    you can get some sort of a clothing, level 15 you can win some money. You level up by earning points which you get from recycling. I think that giving incentive to people who use this app will be motivated to do more recycling. This can act as a
    side money as well for those people who need it. We will have some sort of verification system with recycling centres to avoid misuse and exploitation. The design of this app will be very simple yet effective. We will make sure that the colours
    are easy to the eyes while fonts and formats are easily readable. This app will also user dashboard which will have information about the user like how much they have used the product, how much plastic they have recycled etc. The dash board’s
    interface will be clear and concise. I would like to have simple data on it and not cluttered. I would using avoid confusing graphs and data.</p>

  <p>This app will be made with java this is because java is designed to be easy to use, easy to write code, compile, debug, run and learn than other programming languages. Also the fact that java has the advantage of platform independence. The
    ability to run the same code on many different systems is crucial. The other tool will be of course the Internet where we will get most of our research from. All of the data, facts, figures and statistics will be sourced from the internet. We
    will also be using Geolocation to be able to have the features that we wanted for our app. To be able to utilise geolocation, we will need to learn location services and GPS.</p>


  <p>Skills that are required to be able to make this app are knowledge of Java coding, User Interface, App designing, excellent writing and verbal communication. Having good user interface and design will provide enhanced user experience, smooth
    user interaction and responsiveness. A good User Interface design should have functions that people can easily relate to and understand. Writing skills will also be important because they will allow you to convey your message with clarity and
    ease to a larger audience. For me, one of the most important skills to have is Excellent communication because everything you do in the workplace results from communication.</p>

  <p>The goal of this app is to spread the word and inform more people about the danger of plastic. Promotion plastic recycling and local clean-up activities. If this becomes successful, we can make the world a better place for our future generation.
    Reducing plastic waste will have a lot of benefits not only to us humans but also for the environment, especially for the marine life. By using this app, more people will be aware of the danger of plastic therefore hopefully reducing the use of
    plastic and limiting use of it in our households. This development will impact the health of our ocean and its ecosystem. </p>
